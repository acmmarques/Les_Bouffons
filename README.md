This app was build in Rails by Ana Sousa, André Marques, Loic Thieffry and Manuel Kneib in week 7 of the Le Wagon Web Development Bootcamp in Lisbon (Batch 1041). During week 7 of the bootcamp all teams build a marketplace web-app before starting their final projects in week 8 and 9. Our team decided to build a marketplace for clowns. Until December 2023 you can find it [here](https://bouffons.herokuapp.com/).
This app was build using the [lewagon/rails-templates](https://github.com/lewagon/rails-templates).
